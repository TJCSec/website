- title: What
  text: Computer Security is the field that concerns the attack and
    defense of information systems. The goal of computer security
    specialists is to defend against these attacks and mitigate their
    effects when they do occur. The first step to achieving this goal
    is to understand how these attacks work by becoming a hacker yourself.
    TJCSC serves as an introduction to various aspects of hacking,
    like reverse engineering, cryptography, and website exploitation.
- title: Why
  text: As the world becomes more technology-dependent, it is critical
    that our infrastructure is safe, reliable, and secure. Failure to
    maintain these properties renders any new innovations useless.
    Information security is a deep and diverse field, and it is never
    too early to get started! Technology is everywhere, and security can
    lead into many research programs, internships, and job opportunities.
- title: How
  text: Our lectures are designed to be easy to understand, even for
    total beginners with no experience! We also run a jeopardy-style
    Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competition all year long to let you practice
    the skills you've learned in a challenging but fun competitive
    environment. Join us on Wednesdays during A or B block in the
    Syslab (200)!
